# Bucket Sort Algorithm
Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets.
# How Dose It Work ?

Step 1 : Distribute into buckets

Step 2 : Sort withn each bucket 

Step 3 : Concatenate all buckets.

# Best, Average And Worst Cases :
The best-case occurs when all elements are the same and only one bucket is needed, The average-case
occurs when elements are randomly distributed, And the worst-case occurs when 
all elements fall into the same bucket .
